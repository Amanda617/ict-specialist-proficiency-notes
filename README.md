# ICT SPECIALIST PROFICIENCY EXAMINATION

## FAQs

### What is the ICT Specialist Proficiency Examination?

The ICT Specialist Proficiency Examination is designed to evaluate the competence of an individual to perform programming or systems analysis and design functions. This is pursuant to PD 1408, which directs the National Computer Center (NCC) and the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to devise ways of determining the fitness of individuals in occupying highly technical ICT positions and through which the awarding of appropriate ICT (EDP) Specialist Eligibility will be based. NCC and CSC therefore conduct tests in the area of Computer Programming.

### What Civil Service Eligibility will be granted to successful examinees?

The EDP Specialist Eligibility (EDPSE) shall be conferred to passers of the proficiency test, or passers of the training courses conducted by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), through the National ICT Competency Management Service (NCM), on courses on Systems Analysis and Design and Computer Programming _(granted pursuant to CSC Resolution No. 90-083 dated January 22, 1990)_.

### What positions can the earned eligibility be applied to?

The EDPSE shall be considered appropriate only to functionally related positions belonging to the Information Technology/Management Information System Group, such as Data Encoder, Data Machine Operator, Auxiliary Machine Operator, Data Encoder-Controller, Computer Programmer, Information Systems Analyst, and to other positions as may be determined by the CSC. _(Provided under Item No. 8, Part V of CSC MC No. 12, s. 2003 re: Revised Policies on Qualification Standards)_.

### What are the benefits of the examination? 

The examination can be used: 
- by supervisors to evaluate competence of current or would-be programmers and systems analysts;
- by an individual to assess his/her knowledge and skills for the purpose of continually improving his/her own technical abilities; and
- by ICT training centers to enrich their curricula to enable their students to have a better chance of joining the corps of competent ICT professionals. 

### Who can take the examination?

To qualify, an applicant must be a Filipino citizen and a bachelor's degree holder or will graduate before the exam date (as certified by the Dean of the school) and must have undergone formal training in a college or training institution in the area of Programming.

### How does one apply?

Application forms may be filed personally at the NCM Registrar's Office, 2/F, DICT Bldg., C.P. Garcia Ave., U.P. Diliman, Quezon City; or may be communicated through email at ncm.registrar@dict.gov.ph.

### What documents should be submitted?

All duly accomplished application forms must be filed together with the following:
- Two (2) passport-sized pictures with name tag;

- For those graduating before the examination date, a certification from the Dean that the applicant:
  - is a candidate for graduation before the exam date; and 
  - has taken relevant ICT subjects in college;
- Photocopy of NSO birth certificate

### How is the examination administered?

Starting 2nd quarter of 2017, the certification process of Assess-Build-Certify will be implemented:

**Assess**. All prospective examinees will be assessed by an authorized DICT representative for free. The tool, which the Competency Standards and Certification Management (CSCM) Division will design, will be a written examination that will assess the examinees' knowledge in Programming. It consists of questions on program simulation, number system, data structures, system development life cycle, basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts, basic Networking concepts, file access methods, and basic database concepts. The score attained from this assessment forms 30% of the total score of the examinee should he/she passes the assessment and takes the hands-on examination. Passing score for the Assessment is 25

**Build**. Those who will not pass the assessment may have to undergo additional hours of training and/or learning activities that will enhance the examinee's knowledge and skills in Programming. It is strongly recommended that universities use the Programming curriculum of DICT or have their own curriculum accredited by the Department through its National ICT Competency Management Service. 

**Certify**. Those who pass the assessment will be eligible to take the ICT Proficiency Examination, which will be administered by an authorized CSCM staff. This hands-on examination is a 6-hour simple application development using the examinee's preferred language. Passing score for this exam is 70.

An examinee who gets a rating of 80% or higher will be conferred with DICT's Certificate of Proficiency, which is the basis of CSC's conferment of the EDP (ICT) Specialist Eligibility.

### What languages can be used in the hands-on examination?

Examinees may use any of the following programming languages:
- C Language or C#
- C++
- Java
- Visual Basic 

### How much is the examination fee?
Only successful passers of the Diagnostic Exam will be charged with the examination fee of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) for professionals and Three Hundred Pesos (P300.00) for graduating students.

### When will the result of the examination be released?
The result of the examination will be sent to the examinees via e-mail, six weeks from the date of the examination.

### Where is the examination center?
The examination center is at the Department of Information & Communications Technology, C.P. Garcia Avenue, U.P., Diliman, Quezon City.
